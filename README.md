# RAYAX RYLR998 LoRa radio TX node (STM32G431KB)
An MVP for LoRa communication distance testing - just a few lines of code that sends periodically a predefined message with a timestamp. The complementary RX node is available [here](https://github.com/ufnalski/lora_rylr998_rx_node_g431kb). Modules with AT command support are usually user-friendly, and it was no different this time. Enjoy fast/rapid prototyping of a communication interface for your device and get ready for a walk ahead, which can hopefully be a couple kilometers long :slightly_smiling_face:

# Missing files?
Don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: Just log in to MyST and hit Alt-K to generate /Drivers/CMCIS/ and /Drivers/STM32G4xx_HAL_Driver/ based on the .ioc file. After a couple of seconds your project will be ready for building.
